package handlers

//TODO: add a handler that upgrades clients to a WebSocket connection
//and adds that to a list of WebSockets to notify when events are
//read from the RabbitMQ server. Remember to synchronize changes
//to this list, as handlers are called concurrently from multiple
//goroutines.

//TODO: start a goroutine that connects to the RabbitMQ server,
//reads events off the queue, and broadcasts them to all of
//the existing WebSocket connections that should hear about
//that event. If you get an error writing to the WebSocket,
//just close it and remove it from the list
//(client went away without closing from
//their end). Also make sure you start a read pump that
//reads incoming control messages, as described in the
//Gorilla WebSocket API documentation:
//http://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/websocket
